<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When installing an Eclipse-based tool, all preferences are set to
default. In a team environment, or when upgrading to a new version, you
might want to load existing preferences. Also, you might want to have
default values for your team/organization, but still be able to
customize for your own instance of Eclipse.</p>
<p>Eclipse provides a functionality for the Import and Export of
preferences. However, it only allows for full export of all preferences.
The basic functionality of the <b>Common Preferences</b> plug-in is to
have someone create a preferences file using Export, place it in a
specified place, and then configure users' Eclipse instances to read
this file at startup. The main usage is likely in a team environment,
when a tool administrator will manage the preference file, but it can
also be used in a single user environment.</p>
