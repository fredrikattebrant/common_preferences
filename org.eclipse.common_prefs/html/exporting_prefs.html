<h2>Exporting Preferences</h2>
<p>The Preferences to Export are listed in the <b>Export
Preferences</b> dialog of the <b>Common Preference Export Wizard</b>.
The dialog is accessible via the <a class="command-link"
	href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.file.export")'>Export</a>
wizard by clicking <b>File &gt; Export...</b>, expanding 
<b>General</b> and selecting <b>Common Preferences</b>.</p>

<p>The preferences are grouped based on the respective plug-in they
belong to. This makes it a little difficult to understand exactly what
preference setting you want to export, especially if you have done many
changes to your preferences. Hence, it is good practice to either
start Eclipse with a new workspace or create a &quot;preference
baseline&quot; before changing any of the default preferences you want
to export.</p>
<p>To export preferences:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a preference baseline using the Export
	Preferences dialog as illustrated above. Select all preferences and
	save them to a file (e.g. baseline.epf) by clicking <b>Finish</b>. 
	Note that this step is optional, but recommended for the reason mentioned 
	earlier. Make sure that the <b>Include the preference file in the Common Preferences list</b>
	check-box is selected. This will enable you to filter out these
	settings in the next step.</li>

	<li>Set the preference values you want to export using the
	<a class="command-link"
		href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences")'>Preferences</a>
	dialog (click <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b>). After
	you are done making changes to the preference values, click <b>OK</b>.</li>

	<li>Export the changes you made to a preference file using the
	Export Preferences dialog as illustrated above. Note that each
	individual value is not selectable. This is because a plug-in might
	generally need to keep its saved values consistent. Select one or
	multiple values, and save to a file (e.g. changed_prefs.epf) by
	clicking <b>Finish</b>.</li>

	<li>Store the preference file in an appropriate location.
	If you are planning to use the properties file on your machine, you can
	place it anywhere on the disk. However, if you are planning to share
	the file, it obviously needs to be in a location accessible to all
	clients. Both URLs (i.e. http://changed_prefs.epf) and UNC paths (i.e.
	\\ComputerName\SharedFolder\changed_prefs.epf) are supported as locations.</li>
